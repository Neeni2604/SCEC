836,KSG7-02,Tectonic,"Source: Ridgecrest 2019; Railroad tracks offset on wide fault zone. Fault zone broadens from 35 m in bedrock (to south) to a 100 m wide zone at track. Most deformation in two fault zones 31 m wide. Surveyed the centerline berm and southern edge of track (gravel edge).  Western fault zone has about 2 m wide aperture, and offset range of 52-65 cm.  Eastern fault zone is more challenging to measure as it requires projection across 10 m wide curve in railroad track (note track azimuth on either side are non-parallel, tracks in center appear rotated). Thus, this wider aperture range is 214-233 cm. Summing these values the offset is 278-285 cm across 12 m of two fault apertures.  Correct offset likely higher; the change in track azimuth in center could reflect rotation or accommodation of diffuse shear in alluvium.  Comparison of measured features provides formal uncertainties of 20 cm; this is increased to 50 cm to reflect curvature and diffuse definition of features (i.e., survey tracks not smooth).
