From R. Zinke: two prominent fault strands pass through a channel ~10 m of of Point 432. On the southern strand, there is no discernible right-lateral offset of the contact between the channel bed's pebbly gravels, and the silty channel shoulder. On the northern strand, there could be equivocal evidence for ~5 cm of right-lateral offset as indicated by separation across a small releasing bend, as indicated below.

Eastern fault zone is more challenging to measure as it requires projection across 10 m wide curve in railroad track (note track azimuth on either side are non-parallel, tracks in center appear rotated).
